                We use industry standard precautions to safeguard your personal Information from loss, theft and misuse including unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The servers in which we store your information are kept in a secure physical environment. The servers have industry standard firewalls. Access to such servers is password protected and access by our employees is limited. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer software (&quot;SSL&quot;) to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information including credit card number(s), and names and addresses, as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take commercially reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure from improper actions of third parties not under our control; therefore, we cannot and do not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure.
